# Operating Time

This program tracks the total operating time of a device or process and saves it to a text file. It ensures that the recorded time persists even after a restart.

## Features
- **Accurate time tracking** – measures the total operating time in seconds.
- **Automatic saving** – the time is saved to a specified file every 5 seconds.
- **Resumes from last recorded time** – if the file exists, the program continues counting from the last saved value.

## Usage  
1. Specify the file path where the operating time will be stored.
2. The program will automatically update and save the elapsed time.
3. If the file already exists, the previously recorded time is loaded and counting continues.
